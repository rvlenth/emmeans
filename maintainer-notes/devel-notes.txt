## emmeans devel branch

  * Fix to `.parse_nest()` to handle nested factors with spaces in their name (#562)
  * `col` was not handled properly in `emmip()` (#565)
  * In `emmip()`, changed default for `facetlab` to `"label_both"`. This just
    seems like a better choice.
  * Added a `facetlab` argument to `plot.emmGrid()` -- badly needed when we have
    several `by` groups
