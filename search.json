Another way looking constrains certain external effects zero – opposed averaging otherwise done marginal means. Two things know getting details: submodel option uses information fixed-effects portion model matrix model classes supported submodel option. Now details. Suppose fixed-effects model matrix XX, let X1X_1 denote sub-matrix XX whose columns correspond specified sub-model. (Note: weights, use X=W1/2X*X = W^{1/2}X^*, X*X^* model matrix without weights incorporated.) trick use called alias matrix: =(X1′X1)−X1′XA = (X_1'X_1)^-X_1'X Z−Z^- denotes generalized inverse ZZ. can shown (X1′X1)−X1′=(X′X)−X′(X_1'X_1)^-X_1' = (X'X)^-X'; thus, ordinary fixed-effects regression model, b1=Abb_1 = Ab b1b_1 bb denote regression coefficients sub-model full model, respectively. Thus, given matrix LL LbLb provides estimates interest full model, corresponding estimates sub-model L1b1L_1b_1, L1L_1 sub-matrix LL consisting columns corresponding columns X1X_1. Moreover, L1b1=L1(Ab)=(L1A)bL_1b_1 = L_1(Ab) = (L_1A)b; , can replace LL L1AL_1A obtain estimates sub-model. ’s update(..., submodel = ...) . intuitive observations: Consider excluded effects, X2X_2, consisting columns XX X1X_1. corresponding columns alias matrix regression coefficients treating X2X_2 response X1X_1 predictors. Thus, obtain predictions via aliases, predicting effects X2X_2 based X1X_1. columns new linear predictor L̃=L1A\\tilde L = L_1A depend columns L1L_1, hence columns LL. three points provide three ways saying nearly thing, namely excluding effects X2X_2. Note rank-deficient situation, different possible generalized inverses, (1), AA unique. However, predictions (2) unique. ordinary regression models, (1), (2), (3) apply predictions re-fitting model model matrix X1X_1; however, generalized linear models, mixed models, etc., re-fitting likely produce somewhat different results. fitting models involves iterative weighting, re-fitted models probably weights. However, point (3) still hold: predictions obtained submodel involve columns L1L_1 hence constrain effects outside sub-model zero. Therefore, really matters get correct estimates stated sub-model, user actually fit sub-model unless full model ordinary linear regression. technicality: writers define alias matrix (X1′X1)−X1′X2(X_1'X_1)^-X_1'X_2, X2X_2 denotes part XX excludes columns X1X_1. including columns XX just makes notation simple; X1X_1 portion XX just reduces identity (least case X1X_1 full-rank). word computation: Like many matrix expressions, compute AA directly shown. Instead, use QR decomposition X1X_1, obtainable via R call Z <- qr(X1). alias matrix computed via <- qr.coef(Z, X). fact, nothing changes use just RR portion X=QRX = QR, saving us memory computational effort. exported function .cmpMM() extracts RR matrix, taking care pivoting might occurred. lm object, QR decomposition XX already saved slot. qr.coef() function works just fine full-rank rank-deficient cases, latter situation, elements NA; correspond “excluded” predictors, another way saying constraining regression coefficients zero. Thus, can easily clean via [.na()] <- 0. specify submodel = \"minimal\", software figures sub-model extracting terms involving factors already averaged . user specifies submodel = \"type2\", additional step performed: Let X1X_1 highest-order effect minimal model, X0X_0 denote matrix columns XX whose columns contain effect X1X_1. replace ZZ QR decomposition [−X0(X0′X0)−X0′]X1*[- X_0(X_0'X_0)^-X_0']X_1^*. projects X1*X_1^* onto null space X0X_0. net result obtain estimates just X1*X_1^* effects, adjusting effects don’t contain (including intercept present). estimates limited use data description, provide kind “Type II” analysis used conjunction joint_tests(). \"type2\" calculations parallel documented SAS obtaining type II estimable functions SAS PROC GLM.
