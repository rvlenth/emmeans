## Overview {#overview}
**emmeans** is a continuation of the **lsmeans** package. The name is
changed for two reasons:

  1. The term "least-squares means" is misleading in terms of describing 
     the analyses it provides. The term "estimated marginal means" (EMMs) is
     well-accepted, and it better describes the basic idea that we use
     marginal means of predictions over a reference grid. When we do that
     with, say, an ordinal model, the concept "estimated marginal mean"
     makes sense while "least-squares mean" does not, because no 
     least-squares methods are used to fit the model or obtain the EMMs.
  2. A number of changes are made to the internal architecture of the
     package. The **lsmeans** package had two classes, `ref.grid` and `lsmobj`,
     and it was confusing to some users that they needed to use primarily
     `ref.grid` methods to summarize `lsmobj` objects. The **emmeans**
     package has only an `emmGrid` class that covers both of the old classes.
     Changing the name of the package at the same time as the object 
     classes are changed makes for a cleaner transition.

## User impact {#impact}
For the most part, all that most users need to do to transition from
using the **lsmeans** package is to use `require(emmeans)` 
or `library(emmeans)` to load the package. With that one change,
almost all of the code in the *using-lsmeans* vignette runs without alteration,
and almost all examples from the help system for **lsmeans** also work as-is. 
Even though we
now emphasize using the `emmeans()` function and related "em" functions,
`lsmeans()` and its relatives are still available as wrappers for the new
functions.

That said, here are a few changes that former **lsmeans** users may
need to be aware of:

  * The package provides a utility `emmeans:::convert_scripts()` that may be
    used to convert old scripts that used **lsmeans** to use **emmeans** instead.
    [See more below](#scripts)
  * Some functions are deprecated, e.g. `ref.grid()`, `lsm.options()`, etc.
    As of version 2.3.0, these functions are no longer available at all.
  * While the functions `lsmeans()`, `lsmip()`, etc. will continue to be
    provided, all the help-page and vignette descriptions refer to their
    new counterparts `emmeans()`, `emmip()`, etc. So you will need to
    get accustomed to new terminology like "EMMs", even if you don't
    choose to use it in your own work.
  * If you have any scripts that include calls prefixed by `lsmeans::`,
    or calls to `require(lsmeans)` or `library(lsmeans)`, obviously you
    need to change these to use `emmeans` instead.
  * If you have any custom contrast functions, you need to rename them
    with an extension of `.emmc` instead of `lsmc`. See the example
    under `help("contrast-methods")`.
  * If you have saved results from previous runs in **lsmeans** (i.e.,
    `ref.grid` or `lsmobj` objects), convert the objects to class `emmGrid`
    -- e.g., `my_new_ref_grid <- as.emmGrid(my.old.ref.grid)`.
    Running the non-exported function `emmeans:::convert_workspace()` may
    be used to convert all the objects in an environment (the global
    one by default) and clean out any dependencies on **lsmeans**. 
    [See more below](#workspaces)
  * The `emmip()` and `plot()` functions use graphics from the **ggplot2**
    package by default. If you prefer the **lattice** graphics produced
    by the **lsmeans** package, they are still available: Use 
    `emm_options(graphics.engine = "lattice")` to change the default,
    or add `engine = "lattice"` to the call to for a particular plot.
  * To get complete information about models supported by **emmeans**,
    use [`vignette("models")`](models.html) rather than the help page of the same name.
    It includes a quick reference chart at the beginning that should
    prove helpful.
  * The "using-lsmeans" vignette has been replaced by a number of
    smaller vignettes that cover specific topics. Start with 
    [`vignette("basics")`](basics.html) to obtain an overview.  The
    [vignette index](index.html) has links to all the vignettes.
  * The degrees-of-freedom saga, continued... Initially, **lsmeans** used the
    **pbkrtest** package to compute degrees of freedom (via the Kenward-Roger 
    method) for `lme4::lmerMod` models. Later, the default was changed to the 
    Satterthwaite method, implemented in the **lmerTest** package. Both methods 
    are problematic; but I have decided to revert to the Kenward-Roger method 
    as the system default. The default may be changed via 
    `emm_options(lmer.df = ...)`. See [`vignette("models")`](models.html#L) for details.

## Converting scripts {#scripts}
<!-- @index `convert_scripts()`; **lsmeans** package!Converting scripts -->
The user may run 
```
emmeans:::convert_scripts()
```
to convert R scripts or R Markdown files to use **emmeans** functions. 
(This is a non-exported function -- you need three `:`s in there.)

  * You will get a file-open dialog
    where you can browse for the files -- multiple files may be selected. 
  * You will also be prompted for whether or not you want calls to `lsmeans()` 
    or `pmmeans()`to be replaced by calls to `emmeans()` (it's your choice; the
    former still work).
  * Each converted file is saved in the same directory with `-emm` added to the
    root name; for example, `myfile.R` is converted and saved as `myfile-emm.R`.

The conversion routines will convert the following to their `emmeans` counterparts:

  * `require(lsmeans)` and `library(lsmeans)` to `require(emmeans)` and `library(emmeans)`
  * `lsmeans::` to `emmeans::`
  * `ref.grid(` to `ref_grid(`
  * `lsm.options(` and `get.lsm.option(` to `emm_options(` and `get_emm_option(`
    (arguments thereof are also converted).
  * `.lsmc` to `.emmc` (contrast-method names)
  * `lsmeans(` and relatives to `emmeans(` and relatives, if opted for
  * `pmmeans(` and relatives to `emmeans(` and relatives, if opted for

## Converting workspaces {#workspaces}
<!-- @index `convert_workspace()`; **lsmeans** package!Converting workspaces -->
If you have any objects from the **lsmeans** package laying around, it is
all too likely that the **lsmeans** package will be loaded, and perhaps
even get added to the search path. This can create annoying messages, if not
conflicts. When this happens, type 
```
emmeans:::convert_workspace()
``` 
on the console. This will convert any `ref.grid` or `lsmobj` objects laying
around to the new `emmGrid` class, and unload all vestiges of **lsmeans**.

Once you are comfortable using **emmeans** in place of **lsmeans**, you
may effect a permanent solution (the "nuclear option?") by uninstalling
the **lsmeans** package. Doing so will *not* prevent you from converting old
workspaces or scripts. Watch your package updates carefully, though,
as it may get re-installed if it is still imported by another package.
