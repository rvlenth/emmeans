Description: Obtain estimated marginal means (EMMs) for many linear, generalized 
  linear, and mixed models. Compute contrasts or linear functions of EMMs,
  trends, and comparisons of slopes. Plots and other displays.
  Least-squares means are discussed, and the term "estimated marginal means"
  is suggested, in Searle, Speed, and Milliken (1980) Population marginal means 
  in the linear model: An alternative to least squares means, The American 
  Statistician 34(4), 216-221 <doi:10.1080/00031305.1980.10483031>.
