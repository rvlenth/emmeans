Description: Obtain estimated marginal means (EMMs) for many linear, generalized 
  linear, and mixed models. Compute contrasts or linear functions of EMMs,
  trends, and comparisons of slopes. Plots and compact letter displays.
  Least-squares means are discussed, and the term "estimated marginal means"
  is suggested, in Searle, Speed, and Milliken (1980) Population marginal means 
  in the linear model: An alternative to least squares means, The American 
  Statistician 34(4), 216-221 <doi:10.1080/00031305.1980.10483031>.
