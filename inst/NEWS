Changelog for **emmeans** package
===========================-===

NOTE: **emmeans** is a continuation of the **lsmeans** package. New developments
    will take place in 'emmeans', and 'lsmeans' will remain static
    and eventually will be retired.

## Version 0.9
This is the initial major version that replaces the **lsmeans** package.
Changes shown below are changes made to the last real release of **lsmeans**
(version 2.27-2). **lsmeans** versions greater than that are transitional
to that package being retired.


  * We now emphasize the terminology "estimated marginal means" rather 
    than "least-squares means"

  * The flagship functions are now `emmeans()`, `emtrends()`, `emmip()`, etc.
    But `lsmeans()`, `lstrends()`, etc. as well as `pmmeans()` etc. are
    mapped to their corresponding `emxxxx()` functions.
    
  * In addition, we are trying to avoid names that could get confused as
    S3 methods. So, `ref.grid -> ref_grid`, `lsm.options -> emm_options`, etc.
    
  * Classes `ref.grid` and `lsmobj` are gone.
    Both are replaced by class `emmGrid`. An `as.emmGrid()` function
    is provided to convert old objects to class `emmGrid`.
    
  * I decided to revert back to "kenward-roger" as the default degrees-of-freedom
    method for `lmerMod models`. Also added options `disable.lmerTest`
    and `lmerTest.limit`, similar to those for **pbkrtest**.
    
  * Documentation and NAMESPACE are now "ROxygenated"
  
  * Additional `neuralgia` and `pigs` datasets
  
  * Dispatching of `emmmeans()` methods is now top-down rather than convoluted
    intermingling of S3 methods
    
  * Improved display of back-transformed contrasts when log or logit 
    transformation was used: We change any ` - `s in labels to ` / `s
    to emphasize that thnese results are ratios.
    
  * A message is now displayed when nesting is auto-detected in `ref_grid`.
    (Can be disabled via `emm_options()`)
  
  * Options were added for several messages that users may want to suppress,
    e.g., ones about interactions and nesting.
    
  * Greatly overhauled help page for models. It is now a vignette, 
    with a quick reference chart linked to details, and is
    organized by similarities instead of packages.
    
  * A large number of smaller interlinked vignettes replaces the one
    big one on using the package. Several vignettes are linked in the
    help pages.
    
  * Graphics methods `plot()` and `emmip()` are now **ggplot2**-based.
    Old **lattice**-based functionality is still available too,
    and there is a `graphics.engine` option to choose the default.
    
  * Non-exported utilities convert_workspace() and convert_scripts() to
    help with transition
    
  * Moved `Suggests` pkgs to `Enhances` when not needed for 
    building/testing

  * NEWS file is now structured for Markdown, even though not officially
    a markdown file.
