\title{Reconstruct a reference grid with a new transformation or posterior sample}
\usage{
regrid(object, transform = c("response", "mu", "unlink", "none", "pass",
  links), inv.link.lbl = "response", predict.type,
  bias.adjust = get_emm_option("back.bias.adj"), sigma, N.sim,
  sim = mvtnorm::rmvnorm, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{emmGrid}}

\item{transform}{Character, list, or logical value. If \code{"response"},
\code{"mu"}, or \code{TRUE}, the inverse transformation is applied to the
estimates in the grid (but if there is both a link function and a response
transformation, \code{"mu"} back-transforms only the link part); if
\code{"none"} or \code{FALSE}, \code{object} is re-gridded so that its
\code{bhat} slot contains \code{predict(object)} and its \code{linfct} slot
is the identity. Any internal transformation information is preserved. If
\code{transform = "pass"}, the object is not re-gridded in any way (this
may be useful in conjunction with \code{N.sim}).

If \code{transform} is a character value in \code{links} (which is the set
of valid arguments for the \code{\link{make.link}} function, excepting
\code{"identity"}), or if \code{transform} is a list of the same form as
returned by \code{make.links} or \code{\link{make.tran}}, the results are
formulated as if the response had been transformed with that link function.}

\item{inv.link.lbl}{Character value. This applies only when \code{transform} 
is in \code{links}, and is used to label the predictions if subsequently summarized
with \code{type = "response"}.}

\item{predict.type}{Character value. If provided, the returned object is
updated with the given type to use by default by \code{summary.emmGrid}
(see \code{\link{update.emmGrid}}).  This may be useful if, for example,
when one specifies \code{transform = "log"} but desires summaries to be
produced by default on the response scale.}

\item{bias.adjust}{Logical value for whether to adjust for bias in
back-transforming (\code{transform = "response"}). This requires a value of 
\code{sigma} to exist in the object or be specified.}

\item{sigma}{Error SD assumed for bias correction (when 
\code{transform = "response"} and a transformation
is in effect). If not specified,
\code{object@misc$sigma} is used, and an error is thrown if it is not found.}

\item{N.sim}{Integer value. If specified and \code{object} is based on a 
frequentist model (i.e., does not have a posterior sample), then a fake 
posterior sample is generated using the function \code{sim}.}

\item{sim}{A function of three arguments (no names are assumed).
If \code{N.sim} is supplied with a frequentist model, this function is called
with respective arguments \code{N.sim}, \code{object@bhat}, and \code{object@V}.
The default is the multivariate normal distribution.}

\item{...}{Ignored.}
}
\value{
An \code{emmGrid} object with the requested changes
}
\description{
The typical use of this function is to cause EMMs to be computed on
a different scale, e.g., the back-transformed scale rather than the 
linear-predictor scale. In other words, if you want back-transformed 
results, do you want to average and then back-transform, or 
back-transform and then average?
}
\details{
The \code{regrid} function reparameterizes an existing \code{ref.grid} so
that its \code{linfct} slot is the identity matrix and its \code{bhat} slot
consists of the estimates at the grid points. If \code{transform} is
\code{TRUE}, the inverse transform is applied to the estimates. Outwardly,
when \code{transform = "response"}, the result of \code{\link{summary.emmGrid}}
after applying \code{regrid} is identical to the summary of the original
object using \samp{type="response"}. But subsequent EMMs or
contrasts will be conducted on the new scale -- which is
the reason this function exists. 

This function may also be used to convert a reference grid for a 
frequentist model to one for a Bayesian model. To do so, specify a value
for \code{N.sim} and a posterior sample is simulated using the function \code{sim}.
. The grid may be further processed in accordance with
the other arguments; or if \code{transform = "pass"}, it is simply returned with the 
only change being the addition of the posterior sample.
}
\note{
Another way to use \code{regrid} is to supply a \code{transform} 
  argument to \code{\link{ref_grid}} (either directly of indirectly via
  \code{\link{emmeans}}). This is often a simpler approach if the reference
  grid has not already been constructed.
}
\section{Degrees of freedom}{
  
In cases where the
degrees of freedom depended on the linear function being estimated (e.g.,
Satterthwaite method), the d.f.
from the reference grid are saved, and a kind of \dQuote{containment} method
is substituted in the returned object, whereby the calculated d.f. for a new
linear function will be the minimum d.f. among those having nonzero
coefficients. This is kind of an \emph{ad hoc} method, and it can
over-estimate the degrees of freedom in some cases. An annotation is
displayed below any subsequent summary results stating that the 
degrees-of-freedom method is inherited from the previous method at
the time of re-gridding.

\examples{
pigs.lm <- lm(log(conc) ~ source + factor(percent), data = pigs)
rg <- ref_grid(pigs.lm)

# This will yield EMMs as GEOMETRIC means of concentrations:
(emm1 <- emmeans(rg, "source", type = "response"))
pairs(emm1) ## We obtain RATIOS

# This will yield EMMs as ARITHMETIC means of concentrations:
(emm2 <- emmeans(regrid(rg, transform = "response"), "source"))
pairs(emm2)  ## We obtain DIFFERENCES
# Same result, useful if we hadn't already created 'rg'
# emm2 <- emmeans(pigs.lm, "source", transform = "response")

# Simulate a posterior sample
set.seed(2.71828)
rgb <- regrid(rg, N.sim = 200, transform = "pass")
emmeans(rgb, "source", type = "response")  ## similar to emm1
